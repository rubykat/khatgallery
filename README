==== NAME ====

HTML::KhatGallery - HTML photo album generator.


==== VERSION ====

This describes version ``0.03'' of HTML::KhatGallery.


==== DESCRIPTION ====

HTML::KhatGallery generates a HTML photo gallery. It takes a directory of
images, and generates the HTML pages and thumbnails needed.

This includes the khatgallery script (to generate the gallery) and the
kg_image_info script (to get information about an image).

I decided to write this because, while there are gazillion gallery scripts
out there, none of them do quite what I want, and I wanted to take nice
features from different scripts and bring them together.

*
Pre-generated (baked, not fried)

*
Can recurse down into sub-directories of the top gallery directory.

*
Generates only new files by default.

*
Can clean out unused files.

*
Can force regeneration of HTML or thumbnails.

*
Does not require Javascript.

*
Ability to add plugins.

*
Meta-data from more than just jpeg files.

*
Multi-page albums. That is, directories with lots of images can show only so
many images per index page, instead of having to load every single
thumbnail.

*
Very simple page template, not complicated themes.

*
Pixel-area thumbnails (rather than conforming to particular width or height,
you get higher-quality thumbnails by making them have a given area).

*
XHTML compliant.

*
Dynamic columns with CSS and HTML, rather than fixed tables.


==   The Name   ==

KhatGallery comes from a slight mangling of "Kat's HTML Gallery"; it's so
hard to come up with names that haven't already been used.


==== REQUIRES ====

    Test::More
    POSIX
    File::Basename
    File::Spec
    Cwd
    File::stat
    YAML
    Image::Info
    Image::Magick


==== INSTALLATION ====

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

Or, if you're on a platform (like DOS or Windows) that doesn't like the "./"
notation, you can do this:

   perl Build.PL
   perl Build
   perl Build test
   perl Build install

In order to install somewhere other than the default, such as in a directory
under your home directory, like "/home/fred/perl" go

   perl Build.PL --install_base /home/fred/perl

as the first step instead.

This will install the files underneath /home/fred/perl.

You will then need to make sure that you alter the PERL5LIB variable to find
the modules, and the PATH variable to find the script.

Therefore you will need to change: your path, to include
/home/fred/perl/script (where the script will be)

        PATH=/home/fred/perl/script:${PATH}

the PERL5LIB variable to add /home/fred/perl/lib

        PERL5LIB=/home/fred/perl/lib:${PERL5LIB}
