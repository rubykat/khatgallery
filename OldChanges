Revision history for khatgallery
================================

0.03 Sun 25 February 2007
-------------------------

  * (25 Feb 2007) names with spaces

  spaces in them, thanks to a patch from Chris Benson.

  * (17 Sep 2006) typo fix

0.02 Sun 17 September 2006
--------------------------

  * (17 Sep 2006) fix dist error

0.01 Sun 17 September 2006
--------------------------

  * (17 Sep 2006) layout tweaking
  	Tweaked the index layout so that it looks better in IE.

  * (16 Sep 2006) basename
  	- added file_basename to the meta data for images.

  * (16 Sep 2006) new files check
  	- improved the "new files only" algorithm to check for both
  new and missing files in the current *directory* and to rebuild all
  the HTML files in *that* directory if there is a new or missing file,
  since the index will need changing but also the image HTML files because
  of the prev/next links.
  	- improved some documentation
  	- new get_image_info method, so that (a) it can be overridden
  and (b) so that kg_image_info can use it, so it is always using the
  same data as khatgallery is.

  * (9 Aug 2006) improvements
  - documentation of khatgallery script
  - graceful recovery if Image::Info fails when calculating thumbnail size
  - escaping some HTML characters 
  - adding --options option

  * (6 May 2006) initial checkin
